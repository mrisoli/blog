spoiler: A living list of the tools I am using
---

As I go back to blogging, to write my first post, inspired by [Wes Bos' usage post](https://wesbos.com/uses/), I would discuss and list the tools I use, either professionally or personally, as an avid [Product Hunt user with over 1,700 products upvoted(and counting)](https://www.producthunt.com/@mgrisoli), I enjoy testing out new products and will keep this list updated as things change.

Recently I've also come in contact with one's website where the [creator lists everything he knows](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/), I found it to be a useful, interesting way of keeping and transferring knowledge.

## Static site/Blog

- This blog is built with [Gatsby.js](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/) and deployed to [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/) through its [GitHub](https://github.com/mrisoli/blog) integration, it uses the [Gatsby blog starter](https://github.com/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-blog), forked from [Dan Abramov's blog](https://github.com/gaearon/overreacted.io) with some small CSS modifications of my own, as well as removing some unused features such as translations that I do not expect to utilize any time soon. I am especially surprised at how easy it was to setup Netlify with Github and a simple blog template, including features like PR previews, I have considered moving to [GitLab](https://gitlab.com/) in the past, but as GitHub functions as close to a developer's social network, it feels it's more useful to keep coding entries there.
- Whenever creating new simple sites and doing exercises I prefer to use [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) as a starter, I am a big fan of [ZEIT's](https://zeit.co/) products and their simplicity, as well as its simple design, after starting so many Next.js projects I decided to create my own [boilerplate](https://github.com/mrisoli/nextjs-boilerplate) to aggregate some of the most use toolings that I couple next.js with.

### Runner ups

#### The case against Medium

[I have blogged through Medium](https://medium.com/@celorisoli) before, most of it was to try some forms of content writing, and see what sticks, while centralizing within a content network makes it easier to aggregate views, I found it to encourage simpler, buzzwordy pieces of content that most of the time are not valuable. It also goes against the initial goals of the web, as Medium also adds bigger popups and footers to increase subscription rates and app install counts, it has lost some of its initial allure that promised a clean, content-focused website, and, as a developer, I found it a good hobby to maintain my own website.

- I've used [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/) and [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) a few times, I've found Hugo to be easier to setup even if Jekyll is not that far behind, being older Jekyll also has way more options for themes. Hugo also seems faster. My choice for Gatsby was mostly based on finding it easy to work with the blog starter and the theme.

- [Wordpress](https://wordpress.org/) is a better solution for some companies and is a way more complete CMS, as I didn't intend to do much more than simple writing, I prefered a static site generator since it won't require any hosting and databases and it will all be versioned in a hosted VCS. Static sites will also outperform Wordpress easily, however, Wordpress has better SEO tooling.

## Developer tools

- I've tried [Hyper Terminal](https://hyper.is/) but I end up usually coming back to [iTerm2](https://www.iterm2.com/), as much as it is easier to customize Hyper, I find myself using theme defaults, and Hyper is not yet fast enough as it is still an Electron app.
- I also use [tmux](https://github.com/tmux/tmux) and [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) as terminal tooling, most of my work is in the terminal as I prefer Vim to any other editor, I've also started collecting my [dotfiles](https://github.com/mrisoli/dotfiles) for reuse.
- I am still not sure about programming fonts, but I am growing fond of Iosevka at the moment.
- I don't do much design, but I've started using [Figma](https://www.figma.com/) for wireframing, it replaces my only killer mac app, [Sketch](https://www.sketch.com/), well enough for me and comes with a generous free plan.

### Runners up

- While I use nothing but vim for a while now, I usually recommend and I am very impressed at how good [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) is.

## Coding in

- Most of my work is JavaScript and React these days, preferably Typescript. I also enjoy Vue.JS and will be trying the newest, shiny JavaScript framework du jour from time to time.
- I enjoy using [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net/) to learn about programming languages and stimulate problem solving as a hobby, I've solved over [60 of them](https://github.com/mrisoli/eulerian) in different languages including Haskell, Elixir, Ruby, Python and Go

### I should learn

A few programming languages and technologies which I haven't touched much yet but I am eager to learn:

- Kotlin
- Swift
- containers and k8s
- GraphQL
- Electron
- React Native
- Tensorflow

## Productivity

- This one is a big for me, I've tried just about every productivity app I can find, I am slowly settling on [Notion](https://www.notion.so/) because of how simple and flexible it is, migrating from Evernote and Google Keep, however I still use [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) for tasks as it is still one of the better tools out there for the job including presence in the biggest amount of platforms I've found so far, I still think there is room for improvement in all of these, I miss keybindings in most productivity software.
- [Toby](http://www.gettoby.com/) is my new tab page on Chrome, it has replaced Pocket for me and works better than normal bookmarks

Runner ups
- I like [Workflowy](https://workflowy.com/) and [Dynalist](https://dynalist.io/), just find Notion to be outperforming them.
- [Trello](https://trello.com/) is my favorite team project management tool with [Asana](https://asana.com/) a close second.

Communication & Misc

- I've been tracking my computer and mobile usage with [RescueTime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) and [WakaTime](https://wakatime.com/) to track coding activity
- This has revealed that Instagram is my most commonly used app and is my primary social networking activity, you can still find my resume on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/marcelorisoli/) though
- I've also been growing engagement with Twitter, and [Tweetdeck](https://tweetdeck.twitter.com/) is a must.
- I also like the idea behind [Mastodon](https://joinmastodon.org/) decentralized approach, although I haven't found much within the community yet
- I am using [Station](https://getstation.com/) as a tool to aggregate communication tools, while most communities I participate use [Slack](https://slack.com/), I've enjoyed trying out [Discord](https://discordapp.com/) so far.

News & Media

- My primary resources for news are [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/news) and Reddit. I also enjoy the mechanics behind [Nuzzel](https://nuzzel.com/). I also check [Product Hunt](https://www.producthunt.com/) regularly for new Products and tools.
